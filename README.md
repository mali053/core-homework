# Welcome to the Office Management System!

## System Description

The Task Manager system is a web application designed to facilitate task management within the context of users and administrators.
It provides a user-friendly interface for users to create, update, and delete their tasks, and edit their profile.
while administrators have additional privileges to manage users and their own tasks as well.
the system is built using ASP.NET MVC Web API technology and utilizes JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authorization.

## System Architecture

The application follows a client-server architecture, with a client-side application interacting with server-side APIs, which in turn interacts with json files which are used as database to store and retrieve information. Here's how the various components of the system interact:

### Client-Side Application:

- Developed in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the client-side application is responsible for presenting the user interface (UI) to the end-users.
- It communicates with the server-side APIs, to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and retrieve data via HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) over the network.

### Server-Side APIs:

- The server-side APIs, developed in .NET, act as an intermediary between the client-side application and the json files.
- They handle incoming HTTP requests from the client-side application and execute corresponding logic.
